A project to allow developers to understand more about each complex Github license. 

> Created with NextJS and Tailwind CSS

I get it. Github licenses are tough. When I created my first repository, it took me hours to research and understand the basics about them. 
You are unsure whether to make your project open-source or not. You want people to collaborate but you also want control over your own work.


## Rest assured. I am here to help you. 
With "Coding Licenses Simplified", you can :

- Filter through less restrictive to more restrictive licenses </li>
- Learn more about each license, and find the perfect license - or no license - for your repository. </li> 

  
In fact, this repository is built on an MIT license - if you don't know what an MIT license means, then **take a look the website immediately.**

## Open-source
<ul>
  <li> Contributors are welcome </li>
  <li> Feel free to fork and work on this repository. </li>
</ul>
