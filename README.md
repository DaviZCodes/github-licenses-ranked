# GitHub Licenses Simplified
A project to allow developers to understand more about each complex Github license. 

> Created with NextJS and Tailwind CSS

Github licenses are tough. When I created my first repository, it took me hours to research and understand them. 
You are unsure whether to make your project open-source or not. You want people to collaborate but you also want control over your own work.

With "Coding Licenses Simplified", you can :

- Filter through less restrictive to more restrictive licenses
- Filter through most popular to less popular licenses
- Learn more about each license, and find the perfect license - or no license - for your repository. 

  
In fact, this repository is built on an MIT license - if you don't know what an MIT license means, then **take a look the website immediately.**

## Open-source
